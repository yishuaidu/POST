## Requirement
* elementary programming knowledge
* [**Matlab**](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) as the software to run POST code
## How to run
1. Download POST repository
2. Open Matlab, run the "main.m" file in each subfolder of POST/data.






## Datasets Intro
There are 5 datasets:
* MovieLens, a binary three-mode (user, movie, week) tensor of size 400 ¡Á 400 ¡Á 31 (movielen/movie_400x400x31.mat)
* Twitter Topic, a binary three-mode (user, expert, topic) tensor, of size 500¡Á500¡Á20 (twitter/data.mat)
* ACC, a continuous tensor which records the three-mode interactions (user, action, resource), of size is 3K¡Á150¡Á30K (acc/tensor-data-large/acc.mat)
* DBLP, a binary three-mode (author, conference, keyword) tensor, bibliography relationships, of size 3K¡Á150¡Á30K (dblp/tensor-data-large/dblp.mat)
* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/avazu-ctr-prediction/data), a contest for click-through-rate (CTR) prediction in online advertising, sponsored by Avazu Inc£¬build a four-mode binary tensor (banner_pos,site_id,app_id,device_model), of size 7¡Á2854¡Á4114¡Á6061

**1. Evaluation on Dynamic Tensor Increments**

Twitter Topic and MovieLens followed a similar procedure to MAST to conduct the experiments. 
Randomly chose {50%, 80%, 90%} entries of the entire tensor as missing for each dataset.
The dimension of embedding vectors(Rank), from {3, 5, 8, 10}. In incremental case, the batch size is training data in this increment.

Example:

* Twitter Topic: RUN "twitter/main.m", you can set Rank, say "R" and tune "v", the initial variance of the embeddings.
For random missing data, for example, for 90% missing, we have missing 90% with five mat file, say "omegaT_90_i.mat"

* MovieLens: same as Twitter Topic.

**2. Evaluation on Streaming Tensor Entries in Arbitrary Orders**

Acc(continuous) and DBLP(binary) are examined POST when tensor entries stream in arbitrary orders. 

Example:

* Acc(continuous): RUN "acc/main.m" ,  you can set Rank, say "R" and tune "v" ,the initial variance of the embeddings. In this case, you can set batch size, say "batch_size"

* DBLP(binary): same as Acc



**3. Uncertainty Investigation**

Example:

*Kaggle
